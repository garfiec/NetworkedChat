Due date: Thur, Dec. 7th

### Usage
A makefile is provided for easier compilation. Enter `make` or `make build` to build the project. Enter `make runs` to run the server, and `make runc` to run a client. Start up as many clients as you wish, and you can see the port and IP of the server by looking at the terminal prompt.

To clean up, enter `make clean`.

### NOTES

The resource file is located at `src/com/garfiec/networkchat/common/etc/primes.rsc`. Feel free to update it with your own primes.
